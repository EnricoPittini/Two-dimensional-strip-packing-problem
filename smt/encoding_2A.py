class Vlsi_smt(Vlsi_smt_abstract):
    """Class for solving the VLSI problem in SMT, using the encoding 2A.

    It inherits from the class `Vlsi_smt_abstract`.

    The solving procedure is similar to the previous encodings. SMT variables 'coordX[i]' and 'coordY[i]'.
    In addition, there are also the SMT variable 'l'.
    See the `__solve` method.

    The optimization procedure has been improved, thanks to the variable 'l': it allows to perform the incremental 
    solving.
    Indeed, the SMT encoding is generated only one time, at the beginning. And the solver is started only one time, at the
    beginning (the solver is run on the terminal in incremental mode). 
    Then, a cycle is performed, in which at each iteration a new constraint is injected into the solver, namely the 
    constraint imposing that the length of the plate must be strictly smaller than the current best length already found 
    (this is imposed using the 'l' variable).
    We stop when we find UNSAT.
    Incremental solving.
    It is important to notice that we are performing a linear search, starting from the top (starting from the upper bound, 
    i.e. 'l_max').
    See the `__optimize` method.

class Vlsi_sat(Vlsi_sat_abstract):
    """Class for solving the VLSI problem in SAT, using the encoding 0.

    It inherits from the class `Vlsi_sat_abstract`.

    The solving procedure is based on the SAT variables 'circuit_i_j_k' and 'coord_i_j_k'.
    See the `__solve` method.

    The optimization procedure is very naive. It simply loops through all the possible solutions, keeping the best one.
    At each iteration, the solver is created and run from scratch, with additional constraints imposing to search for a 
    solution different from the ones already found (the already found solutions are not feasible anymore).
    No incremental solving: at each iteration, the solver is created and run from scratch. 
    See the `__optimize` method.

    This encoding is very basic. In particular, the optimization procedure is too naive. 
    It can't be used in practice, because it is too slow.

          '(i,j)' represent two coordinates of the plate, 'k' represents a circuit.

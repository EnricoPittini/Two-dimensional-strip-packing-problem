        Notes
        ------
        The following boolean variables are used
        - circuit_i_j_k, where 'i' in [0,w-w_min], 'j' in [0,l_max-h_min], 'k' in [0,n-1]. 
          '(i,j)' represent two coordinates of the plate, 'k' represents a circuit.
          circuit_i_j_k is True IIF the circuit 'k' is present in the cell '(i,j)' of the plate.
        - coord_i_j_k, where 'i' in [0,w-w_min], 'j' in [0,l_max-h_min], 'k' in [0,n-1].
          '(i,j)' represent two coordinates of the plate, 'k' represents a circuit.
          coord_i_j_k is True IIF the left-bottom corner of the circuit 'k' is put in the cell '(i,j)' of the plate.
        - length_k_l, where 'k' in [0,n-1] and 'l' in [0,l_max-l_min].
          'k' represents a circuit, 'l' represents a length of the plate.
           length_k_l is True IIF the circuit 'k' uses the length 'l' of the plate.
           "A circuit uses a length" means that the circuit reaches or is above that length.
           Actually, the actual length corresponding to the variable 'length_k_l' is not 'l', but l+l_min: 'l' is just an 
           index on the variables 'length_k_l'.
           For going from an index 'l' of 'length_k_l' to the actual length: l+l_min.
           For going from an actual length 'l' to an index of 'length_k_l': l-l_min.
                Example. l_min=3, l_max=9.
                For each circuit 'k', the variables 'length_k_l' are: 
                            - length_k_0 (corresponding to the actual length 3)
                            - length_k_1 (corresponding to the actual length 4)
                            - length_k_2 (corresponding to the actual length 5)
                            ...

        solution, but only the best solution found so far).

        The implementation uses the `__solve` method, which simply configurates the solver at the beginning.

        This optimization procedure consists in performing LINEAR SEARCH with incremental solving, but starting from the 
        bottom (i.e. l_min) instead of the top (i.e. l_max). 

        The solver is created only one time, at the beginning.
        Cycle. At each iteration we have a certain current 'l' that we want to try. We have already tested all the lengths below 
        'l', thus, if this 'l' is SAT, then this 'l' is the best possible 'l'.
        We inject into the solver a new constraint, ensuring that the actual length of the plate is smaller or equal than 'l'. 
        (Since we are sure that all the lengths below 'l' are not SAT, we are basically testing if 'l' is the best length for our
        problem). 
        Then, we solve that current solver instance.
        If SAT, then we simply take the best solution and we exit. If UNSAT, we update l<-l+1, we remove the last constraint 
        injected into the solver (i.e. the one ensuring that the actual length of the plate is smaller or equal than 'l') and we 
        add the new constraint ensuring that the actual length of the plate is strictly bigger than 'l'.
        Then we repeat. 
        At the beginning, l<-l_min.

        INCREMENTAL SOLVING: the solver is created only at the beginning, then we dinamically inject/remove constraints from that

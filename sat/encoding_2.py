class Vlsi_sat(Vlsi_sat_abstract):
    """Class for solving the VLSI problem in SAT, using the encoding 2.

    It inherits from the class `Vlsi_sat_abstract`.

    The solving procedure is similar to the previous encodings. SAT variables 'circuit_i_j_k' and 'coord_i_j_k'.
    In addition, there are also the SAT variables 'length_k_l'.
    See the `__solve` method.

    The optimization procedure has been improved, thanks to the variables 'length_k_l': they allow to perform incremental 
    solving.
    Indeed, the solver is created only one time, at the beginning. Then, a cycle is performed, in which at each iteration 
    new constraints are injected into the solver, namely: the constraints imposing that the already found solutions are not 
    feasible anymore (like in the previous encodings); the constraints imposing that the lengths of the plate bigger than 
        the current best length are not feasible anymore (this is done using the 'length_k_l' variables).
    Incremental solving.

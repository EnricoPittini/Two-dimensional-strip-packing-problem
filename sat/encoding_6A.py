class Vlsi_sat(Vlsi_sat_abstract):
    """Class for solving the VLSI problem in SAT, using the encoding 6A.

    It inherits from the class `Vlsi_sat_abstract`.

    The solving encoding has been changed with respect to the previous encodings. 
    Now the SAT variables 'coord_i_j_k' are not used anymore: less variables. The aim is to try to eliminate the redundancy
    of having two grid of variables 'coord_i_j_k' and 'circuit_i_j_k'.
    Of course, this implies that different constraints must be ensured.

    The variables 'length_k_l' remain the same (as encoding 4), and also the constraints about them.
    The optimization procedure is exactly the same of the previous encodings (seen from the encoding 2).

    Finally, the improved bounds for the SAT variables (seen from the encoding 3) are used.

            See `Notes`.

        Notes
        ------
        The following boolean variables are used
        - circuit_i_j_k, where 'i' in [0,w-w_min], 'j' in [0,l_max-h_min], 'k' in [0,n-1]. 
          '(i,j)' represent two coordinates of the plate, 'k' represents a circuit.
          circuit_i_j_k is True IIF the circuit 'k' is present in the cell '(i,j)' of the plate.
        - length_k_l, where 'k' in [0,n-1] and 'l' in [0,l_max-l_min].
          'k' represents a circuit, 'l' represents a length of the plate.
           length_k_l is True IIF the circuit 'k' uses the length 'l' of the plate.
           "A circuit uses a length" means that the circuit reaches or is above that length.
           Actually, the actual length corresponding to the variable 'length_k_l' is not 'l', but l+l_min: 'l' is just an 
           index on the variables 'length_k_l'.
           For going from an index 'l' of 'length_k_l' to the actual length: l+l_min.
           For going from an actual length 'l' to an index of 'length_k_l': l-l_min.
                Example. l_min=3, l_max=9.
                For each circuit 'k', the variables 'length_k_l' are: 
                            - length_k_0 (corresponding to the actual length 3)
                            - length_k_1 (corresponding to the actual length 4)
                            - length_k_2 (corresponding to the actual length 5)
                            ...

class Vlsi_sat(Vlsi_sat_abstract):
    """Class for solving the VLSI problem in SAT, using the encoding 10B.

    It inherits from the class `Vlsi_sat_abstract`.

    The solving procedure is the same of the encoding 10A. SAT variables 'px_i_e', 'py_i_f, 'lr_i_j', 'ud_i_j' and 'ph_o'.
    See the `__solve` method.

    The optimization is instead improved. 
    It is still used the binary search, but now in an incremental way. INCREMENTAL SOLVING.
    Again, as suggested in the paper *'A SAT-based Method for Solving the Two-dimensional Strip Packing Problem'*.

    The solver is created only one time, at the beginning.
    Cycle. At each iteration we have a certain lower bound (i.e. lb) and a certain upper bound (i.e. ub) for the length of 
    the plate. We take as length of the plate of interest 'l' the middle between lb and ub. We inject into the solver a new 
    constraint, ensuring that the actual length of the plate is smaller or equal than 'l' (i.e. ph_{l-l_min}). 
    Then, we solve that current solver instance.
    If SAT, then we simply update ub<-l. If UNSAT, we update lb<-l+1, we remove the last constraint injected into the
    solver (i.e. ph_{l-l_min}) and we add the new constraint ensuring that the actual length of the plate is strictly bigger
    than 'l' (i.e. ¬ph_{l-l_min}).
    Then we repeat. 
    At the beginning, lb<-l_min (minimum length of the plate) and ub<-l_max (maximum length of the plate) 
    INCREMENTAL SOLVING: the solver is created only at the beginning, then we dinamically inject/remove constraints from that
    solver. For obtaining this behaviour, we use the assertions stack (we push/pop levels into that stack).
    See the `__optimize` method.


    ---- PRACTICAL DIFFERENCES WITH ENCODING 10A ----
    In the encoding 10A, there is the binary search cycle, but at each iteration the solver is created and run from sratch,
    with the additional information of the current lenght 'l' of interest: in this way, an additional constraint is ensured,
    namely 'ph_{l-l_min}' (it ensures that the actual length of the plate is smaller or equal than 'l').

    In the encoding 10B, there is still the binary search cycle, but the solver is created only one time at the beginning, 
    and in each iteration the solver is simply incrementally modified, by adding/retracting the constraints 'ph_{l-l_min}'
    (and also by adding the constraints '¬ph_{l-l_min}').

        Notes
        ------
        The following SAT variables are used.
        - px_i_e, where 'i' in [0,n-1] and 'e' in [0,w-1].
          'i' represents a circuit, 'e' a width of the plate.
          px_i_e is True IIF the x coordinate of left-bottom corner of the circuit 'i' is lower or equal than 'e' (i.e. xi<=e).
        - py_i_f, where 'i' in [0,n-1] and 'f' in [0,l_max-1].
          'i' represents a circuit, 'h' a length of the plate.
          py_i_f is True IIF the y coordinate of left-bottom corner of the circuit 'i' is lower or equal than 'f' (i.e. yi<=f).
        - lr_i_j, where 'i' and 'j' are in [0,n-1].
          'i' and 'j' represent two circuits.
          lr_i_j is True IIF the circuit 'i' is placed at the left to 'j'.
        - ud_i_j, where 'i' and 'j' are in [0,n-1].
          'i' and 'j' represent two circuits.
          ud_i_j is True IIF the circuit 'i' is placed at the downward to 'j'.  
        - ph_o, where 'o' represents a length.
          o in [0,l_max-l_min].
          'o' does not represent an actual length, but an index (on [l_min,l_max]). The corresponding actual length is l_o=o+l_min.
          So:
              from actual length 'l_o' to index 'o' ==> o=l_o-l_min;
              from index 'o' to actual length 'l_o' ==> l_o=o+l_min.
          ph_o is True IFF each circuit is below or at the same level of the length 'o'. 
          More precisely, ph_o is True IFF each circuit is below or at the same level of the length l_o=o+l_min.
          Formally:  ph_o is True IFF ∀i yi+hi<=l_o (where l_o=o+l_min)

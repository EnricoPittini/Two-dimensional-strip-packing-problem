class Vlsi_sat(Vlsi_sat_abstract):
    """Class for solving the VLSI problem in SAT, using the encoding 6B.

    It inherits from the class `Vlsi_sat_abstract`.

    Very similar to the encoding 6A.
    The only difference is about the SAT variables 'length_k_l'.
    We don't use these variables anymore, but we use the variables 'length_l' (and, so, we use also different constraints).

    This is the same change seen in the encoding 5: alternative approach for the optimization procedure.

    Remark: we remind that the improved bounds for the SAT variables 'circuit_i_j_k' and 'coord_i_j_k' can't be used anymore 
    (basically, we can't use the bounds w-w_min and l_max-h_min). We can use only the bounds on 'length_l': l in [0,l_max-l_min].

        lengths : list of list of z3.z3.BoolRef

        Notes
        ------
        The following boolean variables are used
        - circuit_i_j_k, where 'i' in [0,w-w_min], 'j' in [0,l_max-h_min], 'k' in [0,n-1]. 
          '(i,j)' represent two coordinates of the plate, 'k' represents a circuit.
          circuit_i_j_k is True IIF the circuit 'k' is present in the cell '(i,j)' of the plate.
        - length_l, where 'l' in [0,l_max-l_min].
           'l' represents a length of the plate.
           length_l is True IIF the length 'l' is the maximum length of the plate.
           Actually, the actual length corresponding to the variable 'length_l' is not 'l', but l+l_min: 'l' is just an 
           index on the variables 'length_l'.
           For going from an index 'l' of 'length_l' to the actual length: l+l_min.
           For going from an actual length 'l' to an index of 'length_l': l-l_min.
                Example. l_min=3, l_max=9.
                Te variables 'length_l' are: 
                            - length_0 (corresponding to the actual length 3)
                            - length_1 (corresponding to the actual length 4)
                            - length_2 (corresponding to the actual length 5)
                            ...

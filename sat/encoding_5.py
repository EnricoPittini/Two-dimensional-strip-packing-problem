class Vlsi_sat(Vlsi_sat_abstract):
    """Class for solving the VLSI problem in SAT, using the encoding 5.

    It inherits from the class `Vlsi_sat_abstract`.

    Very similar to the encoding 4A.
    The only difference is about the SAT variables 'length_k_l'.
    We don't use these variables anymore, but we use other variables.

    Now we use the SAT variables 'length_l': see the `__solve` method.
    And, of course, different constraints are used: see the `__process_solver_instance` method.

    Basically, we are using an alternative approach for the optimization procedure: different variables and different 
    constraints.

    Remark: the improved bounds for the SAT variables 'circuit_i_j_k' and 'coord_i_j_k' can't be used anymore (basically,
    we can't use the bounds w-w_min and l_max-h_min).
    We can use only the bounds on 'length_l'.

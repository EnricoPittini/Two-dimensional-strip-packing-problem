        The following boolean variables are used
        - circuit_i_j_k, where 'i' in [0,w-w_min], 'j' in [0,l_max-h_min], 'k' in [0,n-1]. 
          '(i,j)' represent two coordinates of the plate, 'k' represents a circuit.
          circuit_i_j_k is True IIF the circuit 'k' is present in the cell '(i,j)' of the plate.
        - coord_i_j_k, where 'i' in [0,w-w_min], 'j' in [0,l_max-h_min], 'k' in [0,n-1].
          '(i,j)' represent two coordinates of the plate, 'k' represents a circuit.
          coord_i_j_k is True IIF the left-bottom corner of the circuit 'k' is put in the cell '(i,j)' of the plate.
        - length_k_l, where 'k' in [0,n-1] and 'l' in [0,l_max-l_min].
          'k' represents a circuit, 'l' represents a length of the plate.
           length_k_l is True IIF the circuit 'k' uses the length 'l' of the plate.
           Actually, the actual length corresponding to the variable 'length_k_l' is not 'l', but l+l_min: 'l' is just an 
           index on the variables 'length_k_l'.
           For going from an index 'l' of 'length_k_l' to the actual length: l+l_min.
           For going from an actual length 'l' to an index of 'length_k_l': l-l_min.
                Example. l_min=3, l_max=9.
                For each circuit 'k', the variables 'length_k_l' are: 
                            - length_k_0 (corresponding to the actual length 3)
                            - length_k_1 (corresponding to the actual length 4)
                            - length_k_2 (corresponding to the actual length 5)
                            ...

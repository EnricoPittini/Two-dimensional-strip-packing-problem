class Vlsi_smt(Vlsi_smt_abstract):
    """Class for solving the VLSI problem in SMT, using the encoding 5B.

    It inherits from the class `Vlsi_smt_abstract`.

    Like the encoding 5A, also this encoding solves the rotation variant of the problem.

    The starting point is the encoding 5A, and then it is slightly modified for trying to improve the performanes.

    The optimization procedure is exactly the same of the encoding 5A: incremental solving and linear search from the bottom.
    See the `__optimize` method.


    --- SUPPORTED SOLVERS ---
    Only solvers 'z3' and 'cvc5' are supported. No 'yices-smt2' ('yices-smt2' recquires that a specific logic is specified).

  
    --- MODIFICATION OF THE ENCODING 5A ---
    The only difference with respect to the encoding 5A is that the domain constraints are enforced without the usage of the 
    variables 'actual_dimsX[i]' and 'actual_dimsY[i]'. They are defined using directly the variables 'r[i]', in a lower-level
    way.    

    Domain of each 'coordX[i]'.
        - coordX[i]>=0.
        - If the 'i'-circuit has not been rotated, then coordX[i]<=w-dimsX[i].
          Which is equivalent to:  r[i] \/ coordX[i]<=w-dimsX[i].
        - If the 'i'-circuit has been rotated, then coordX[i]<=w-dimsY[i].
          Which is equivalent to:  ¬r[i] \/ coordX[i]<=w-dimsY[i].

    Domain of each 'coordY[i]'.
        - coordY[i]>=0.
        - If the 'i'-circuit has not been rotated, then coordY[i]<=l_max-dimsY[i].
          Which is equivalent to:  r[i] \/ coordY[i]<=l_max-dimsY[i].
        - If the 'i'-circuit has been rotated, then coordY[i]<=l_max-dimsX[i].
          Which is equivalent to:  ¬r[i] \/ coordY[i]<=l_max-dimsX[i].

        The SMT encoding is generated as a single string, containing the SMT-LIB code, which will be passed to the solver.

        Remark: this returned string contains only the encoding, and it does not contain the SAT check and the "get model"
        instruction.

        Parameters
        ----------
        l_max : int
            Maximum length of the plate.

        Returns
        -------
        encoding_string : str
            Single string containing the encoding. More specifically, it contains the SMT-LIB lines.

        Notes
        ------
        The following SMT variables are used.
        - coordX[i], where 'i' in [0,n-1].
          coordX[i] is the x coordinate of the bottom-left vertex of the 'i'-th circuit.
        - coordY[i], where 'i' in [0,n-1].
          coordY[i] is the y coordinate of the bottom-left vertex of the 'i'-th circuit.
        - l
          It represents the length of the plate.
        - r[i], where 'i' represents a circuit. i in [0,n].
          r[i] is True IFF the 'i'-th rectangle has been rotated, meaning that dimsX[i] and dimsY[i] have been swapped.
        - actual_dimsX[i], where 'i' in [0,n-1].
          actual_dimsX[i] is the actual horizontal dimension (i.e. width) of the i-th circuit.
        - actual_dimsY[i], where 'i' in [0,n-1].
          actual_dimsY[i] is the actual vertical dimension (i.e. heigth) of the i-th circuit.

        It performs optimization: the best solution is found (if any).
        (If this class is used as a parallel process with a time limit, there is not gurantee of founding the optimal 
        solution, but only the best solution found so far).

        The optimization procedure is the following.
        The SMT encoding is generated only one time, at the beginning. And the solver is started only one time, at the
        beginning (the solver is run on the terminal in incremental mode).
        Cycle. At each iteration we have a certain current 'l' that we want to try. We have already tested all the lengths below 
        'l', thus, if this 'l' is SAT, then this 'l' is the best possible 'l'.
        We inject into the solver a new constraint, ensuring that the actual length of the plate is equal to 'l'. 
        (Since we are sure that all the lengths below 'l' are not SAT, we are basically testing if 'l' is the best length for our
        problem). 
        Then, we solve that current solver instance.
        If SAT, then we simply take the best solution and we exit. If UNSAT, we update l<-l+1, we remove the last constraint 
        injected into the solver (i.e. the one ensuring that the actual length of the plate is equal to 'l').
        Then we repeat. 
        At the beginning, l<-l_min.

        INCREMENTAL SOLVING: the solver is created only at the beginning, then we dinamically inject/remove constraints from that
        solver. For obtaining this behaviour, we use the assertions stack (we push/pop levels into that stack).

        Notes
        ------
        - The solver is run on the terminal in **incremental mode**. This means that the solver process remains alive, and 
          always waits for the user new constraints. 
        - The solution is communicated to the user through the `results` dictionary, which is shared between the class and the 
          user. 
          Each time a better solution is found, it is injected to the `results` dictionary.

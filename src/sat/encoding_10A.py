class Vlsi_sat(Vlsi_sat_abstract):
    """Class for solving the VLSI problem in SAT, using the encoding 10A.

    It inherits from the class `Vlsi_sat_abstract`.

    The solving procedure is the same of the encoding 10. SAT variables 'px_i_e', 'py_i_f, 'lr_i_j' and 'ud_i_j'.
    In addition, there are also the SAT variables 'ph_o': they are introduced for improving the optimization procedure.
    See the `__solve` method.

    The optimization procedure has been improved, thanks to the variables 'ph_o'.
    In addition, the binary search is now used instead of the linear search. 
    Cycle. At each iteration we have a certain lower bound (i.e. lb) and a certain upper bound (i.e. ub) for the length of 
    the plate. We try to solve the problem, by running the solver from scratch, and by fixing the actual length of the plate 
    as smaller or equal than 'l', where 'l' is computed as ceil((lb+ub)/2). If SAT, we update ub<-l, if UNSAT we update 
    lb<-l+1. Then we repeat. 
    At the beginning, lb<-l_min (minimum length of the plate) and ub<-l_max (maximum length of the plate) 
    No incremental solving: at each iteration, the solver is created and run from scratch. 
    See the `__optimize` method.

    This improving of the optimization procedure, by means of the variables 'ph_o' and by means of the binary search, is 
    again taken from the paper *'A SAT-based Method for Solving the Two-dimensional Strip Packing Problem'*.


    --- VARIABLES ph_o ---
    These variables are again inspired by the order encoding, presented in the previous encoding class 10.

    ph_o, where 'o' represents a length.
    o in [0,l_max-l_min].
    'o' does not represent an actual length, but an index (on [l_min,l_max]). The corresponding actual length is l_o=o+l_min.
    So:
        from actual length 'l_o' to index 'o' ==> o=l_o-l_min;
        from index 'o' to actual length 'l_o' ==> l_o=o+l_min.
    ph_o is True IFF each circuit is below or at the same level of the length 'o'. 
    More precisely, ph_o is True IFF each circuit is below or at the same level of the length l_o=o+l_min.
    Formally:  ph_o is True IFF ∀i yi+hi<=l_o (where l_o=o+l_min)


    --- CONSTRAINTS ON ph_o ---
    For each circuit 'i' and for each 'o' in [0,l_max-l_min], we impose:
                ph_o -> py_i_{o+l_min-dimsY[i]}
    which is equivalent to:
                ¬ph_o \/ py_i_{o+l_min-dimsY[i]}
    Basically, this means that if ph_o is True then the circuit 'i' is below or at most the same level of the length l_o=o+l_min.
    Formally, yi+hi<=l_o, where l_o=o+l_min.
    On the whole, we have:
                ∀i∈[0,n-1] ∀o∈[0,l_mix-l_min] ¬ph_o \/ py_i_{o+l_min-dimsY[i]}

    Then, we put the usual constraint for the order encoding.
    Namely, for each 'o', we have to put:
                (¬ph_o \/ ph_{o+1})    (which is equivalent to ∀e (¬ph_o -> ph_{o+1}))

    Finally, we have to ensure that the actual length of the plate is smaller or equal the given 'l'.
    We simply add the constraint that ph_{l-l_min} is True.  (o=l-l_min is the index corresponding to the actual length 'l').
        

    --- SUM UP ---
    The constraints are the following.
    O1) ∀i∈[0,n-1] ∀o∈[0,l_mix-l_min] ¬ph_o \/ py_i_{o+l_min-dimsY[i]}
    O2) ∀o∈[0,l_mix-l_min-1] (¬ph_o \/ ph_{o+1})
    O3) ph_{l-l_min}

        ------
        The following SAT variables are used.
        - px_i_e, where 'i' in [0,n-1] and 'e' in [0,w-1].
          'i' represents a circuit, 'e' a width of the plate.
          px_i_e is True IIF the x coordinate of left-bottom corner of the circuit 'i' is lower or equal than 'e' (i.e. xi<=e).
        - py_i_f, where 'i' in [0,n-1] and 'f' in [0,l_max-1].
          'i' represents a circuit, 'h' a length of the plate.
          py_i_f is True IIF the y coordinate of left-bottom corner of the circuit 'i' is lower or equal than 'f' (i.e. yi<=f).
        - lr_i_j, where 'i' and 'j' are in [0,n-1].
          'i' and 'j' represent two circuits.
          lr_i_j is True IIF the circuit 'i' is placed at the left to 'j'.
        - ud_i_j, where 'i' and 'j' are in [0,n-1].
          'i' and 'j' represent two circuits.
          ud_i_j is True IIF the circuit 'i' is placed at the downward to 'j'.  
        - ph_o, where 'o' represents a length.
          o in [0,l_max-l_min].
          'o' does not represent an actual length, but an index (on [l_min,l_max]). The corresponding actual length is l_o=o+l_min.
          So:
              from actual length 'l_o' to index 'o' ==> o=l_o-l_min;
              from index 'o' to actual length 'l_o' ==> l_o=o+l_min.
          ph_o is True IFF each circuit is below or at the same level of the length 'o'. 
          More precisely, ph_o is True IFF each circuit is below or at the same level of the length l_o=o+l_min.
